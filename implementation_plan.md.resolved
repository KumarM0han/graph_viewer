# Integrating OGDF Library

We will integrate the Open Graph Drawing Framework (OGDF) into your C++ project under the `vendor/` directory, keeping only the compiled library and headers to save space and compilation time.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Clone and Build OGDF**:
   - Clone the OGDF repository (`https://github.com/ogdf/ogdf.git`) into a temporary folder in `vendor/`.
   - Run `cmake` to configure and build OGDF in Release mode.
   
2. **Install and Clean Up**:
   - Use `cmake --install` to extract only the compiled libraries (`.lib`/`.a`) and the `include/` directory into `vendor/ogdf`.
   - Delete the enormous source tree and build artifacts so your repository focuses only on what's strictly necessary.

3. **Update [CMakeLists.txt](file:///c:/Users/z004kv4t/Desktop/another_gui/graph_viewer/CMakeLists.txt)**:
   - Add `vendor/ogdf/include` to `target_include_directories`.
   - Find the compiled OGDF library in `vendor/ogdf/lib` or `vendor/ogdf/bin` and add it to `target_link_libraries`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated/Compiler Verification
- Run `cmake --build .\build\` from your project root. If the project links successfully and can `#include <ogdf/basic/Graph.h>`, the integration is successful.

### Manual Verification
- We will instantiate a basic `ogdf::Graph` and `ogdf::GraphAttributes` in [main.cpp](file:///c:/Users/z004kv4t/Desktop/another_gui/graph_viewer/src/main.cpp) to ensure the symbols resolve at runtime and it doesn't crash on startup.
